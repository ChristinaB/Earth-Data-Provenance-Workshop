We look forward to seeing everyone in Seattle next month for the Earth Data Provenance Workshop. Please plan to arrive by the evening of Monday, March 26th and depart Thursday, March 29th after 2pm - we will wrap-up the workshop by noon on Thursday. The daily-detailed agenda has not been finalized yet (once we have a draft, it will be posted [here](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Earth-Data-Provenance-Workshop/wiki)), but we’d like to pass along the following travel guidance:  

### **Hotel**

Please make your hotel reservation at the [Watertown Hotel](https://www.staypineapple.com/watertown-hotel-seattle-wa). They are offering the GSA per-diem rate for Seattle at $179/night. Enter 'ESIP' as the Group code for the GSA rate. Please book your room by **March 1st**.

### **Meeting Location**

The workshop will be held at the eScience Institute on the 6th floor of the Physics and Astronomy building in the [WRF Data Science Studio](http://escience.washington.edu/wrf-data-science-studio/) - this is walking distance from the hotel - see directions here: [https://goo.gl/maps/unu66bfGLru](https://goo.gl/maps/unu66bfGLru)

### **Air Travel**

ESIP will cover airfare to Seattle-Tacoma Airport arriving March 26th, departing March 29th. If you plan to travel on different dates, ESIP will only cover the portion of airfare this is comparable to the workshop travel dates. 

Expenses for commercial air travel are reimbursed on the basis of the actual cost incurred by the traveler using normally traveled routes in compliance with the ‘[Fly America Act](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103191)’, and at the most economical rate. If the total flight cost is over $500 and you hope to be reimbursed, it must get pre-approval.	

### **Ground Transportation**

* ESIP will cover reasonable transportation costs to and from the airport, and baggage fees, but receipts must be included for any expense over $15.

* ** Rental car use should be limited to situations where other means of transportation are not practical, economical or available. 

* ** The use of personal vehicles is discouraged, except for regional travel, and to and from a ‘home’ airport.  Prior approval is required for all other journeys.

### **Meal Expenses**

ESIP reimburses meal and incidental expenses based on standard [GSA per-diem rates](https://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101518) in effect at the time of travel and according to the geographic area involved less any meals provided by conference or workshop.

** Several of the workshop meals will be group meals paid by ESIP, so GSA reimbursement will only be for on-your-own meals. 

### **Miscellaneous Expenses**

Miscellaneous expenses, such as charges for ground transportation and parking, are reimbursable upon submission of original receipts.

### **Non-reimbursable expenses include, but are not limited to:**

* Personal entertainment expenses (e.g., movies, games, health club or spa)
* Optional conference activities not included in the standard conference fee, for which prior approval has not been sought
* Valet parking, unless a hotel prohibits guests from parking their own vehicles
* Travel accident insurance premiums
* Costs incurred by failure to cancel transportation lodging
* Cost incurred by failure to use our hotel block and not getting the ESIP rate.
* Traffic and/or parking violation fines
* Rental car accessories (e.g., navigation system, infant car seat)
* Repairs to personal vehicles used for ESIP-related travel
* Spouse, partner or other family member’s expenses
* Laundry service
* Room service

### **Submitting your Expense Report**

All requests for reimbursements of travel related expenses must be properly documented and submitted to the ESIP Office within 30 days of the travel being completed.  Please make a copy of [this blank expense report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEn7uQDjmC7-Kdhb55CAVK8mzoQzj3Y48Pomf94NZMA/edit?usp=sharing) and input all reimbursable expenses.  

**Please combine your expense report and all receipts into a single pdf file and submit to **billing@esipfed.org**.**
