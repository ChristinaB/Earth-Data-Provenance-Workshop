Joe Hamman is a postdoctoral researcher with NCAR. Just submitted a proposal to NASA aimed at building improved APIs for access to satellite datasets from the DAACs. This would be build around the already-NSF-funded Pangeo project. The project would provide Jupyter Notebook access to powerful Python libraries (e.g. Xarray, for which Joe is a lead developer) deployed in the commercial cloud to enable subsetting and aggregation of NASA datasets.
