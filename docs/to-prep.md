A few pre-workshop tasks: 

If you've developed a system for collecting provenance information, please add a .md file listing relevant work to the [docs folder](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Earth-Data-Provenance-Workshop/tree/master/docs) in this repo or plan to give a lightning talk (~5 minutes) at the beginning of the workshop.

If you'd like to give a lightning talk of the work you've done around provenance, please add your name name to the [detailed agenda](https://github.com/ESIPFed/Earth-Data-Provenance-Workshop/wiki/Detailed-Agenda-(Draft)) where the text says 'presenter 1.'
