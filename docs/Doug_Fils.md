I've been exploring prov recently in relation to the Open Core project to use it as a means
to help track the flow from data facilities (scientific drilling) to down stream community data systems.
Lots of data flows into these systems but it's hard to maintain an understanding of where it came
from any any potential transforms along the way to map to local data models.  

I've been joining in on the RDA Prov calls lead by Nick Car at CISRO (formally Geosciences Australia).  
He has done work along with Simon Cox on prov for physical samples which is also potentially useful 
to the scientific drilling community.


Most recently, I worked with Tom Narock on an ESIP-funded PROV project we called <a href="https://provisium.io/">Provisium</a>. 
Code is available in <a href="https://github.com/esipfed/provisium">this GitHub repo</a>. In this project, we looked at how the
W3C PROV-AQ spec could be applied to Earth sciences and cross-organizational provenance sharing.
