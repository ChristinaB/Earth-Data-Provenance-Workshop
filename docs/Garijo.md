## Daniel Garijo
I have collaborated in several provenance initiatives throughout my masters and PhD:

* I was a member of the W3C Provenance Incubator Working Group, which aimed to create a roadmap, next steps, requirements and state of the art on provenance. The final report of the group can be found in: https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/prov/XGR-prov-20101214/
* I was a member of the W3C Provenance Working Group, which aimed to create a standard for provenance in the Web. I coauthored the provenance ontology PROV-O (https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/), and I also was a co-author of the mapping between PROV and Dublin Core: https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dc/
* I also participated in the Dublin Core Metadata Provenance Task Group: http://dublincore.org/groups/provenance/, which aimed to describe metadata provenance from Dublin Core (this issue was later addressed in the W3C standard, using prov:Bundles)

As for the initiatives that I have participated publishing provenance:

* Publishing provenance as Linked Data in a news-scenario: We captured the provenance of travel guides from one of the major publishing agencies in spain and published it online according to the Open provenance Model (a predecesor of PROV) http://webenemasuno.linkeddata.es/index_en.html
* Publishing provenance from scientific workflows as Linked Data: As part of my PhD thesis, I worked on representing the inputs, outputs, intermediate results, software scripts and other dependencies that are related to scientific workflows by extending OPM and then PROV. The model is available here: http://www.opmw.org/ontology/. Examples on using the model can be found in http://www.opmw.org/node/6, and a repository with more than 100 workflows published can be found in http://opmw.org/sparql 

My recent work has focused on exploiting provenance for visualization of workflows (https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/Workflow-Explorer) and explaining the history of results (https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/DataNarratives)
