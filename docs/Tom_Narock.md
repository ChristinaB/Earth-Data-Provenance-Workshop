Part of my PhD dissertation in 2012 used provenance as a means of discovering semantic web services. Although, interest in these types
of services seems to have wained in recent years. At the time, web service discovery was based on semantic descriptions of service
inputs and outputs. For many web services, in particular scientific web services, not describing the algorithmic assumptions and 
limitations limits discovery. We looked at using provenance descriptions of the services to extend existing discovery approaches. 
The paper that resulted from this can be found

We had investigated provenance in our EarthCube project <a href="http://www.geolink.org/">GeoLink</a>. However, time constraints limited
from actually implementing a provenance system.<br/><br/>

Most recently, I worked with Doug Fils on an ESIP-funded PROV project we called <a href="https://provisium.io/">Provisium</a>. 
Code is available in <a href="https://github.com/esipfed/provisium">this GitHub repo</a>. In this project, we looked at how the
W3C PROV-AQ spec could be applied to Earth sciences and cross-organizational provenance sharing.
